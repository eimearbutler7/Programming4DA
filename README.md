# Programming for Data Analysis (10 credits) 

This repository contains the **Programming** for Data Analysis Assignment (Oct/Nov 2018).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "P4DA_Assignment.ipynb".

All supplimentary documentation begins with a "z_" in order for it to remain at the bottom of the list of files.

NOTE: much research and code was prepared while I spent significant time travelling for work this month and was added to the Jupyter Notebook over a small numebr of days while I was home and had access to the computer running Anaconda/Python etc. The activity tracker may not look very impresive in git hub but activities were happening offline.
